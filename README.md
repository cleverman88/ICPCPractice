## Data Structures

### Fenwick Tree / Binary Search Tree

Used to perform range sum queries with updates and queries in O(log n) time.

### Segment Tree

Similar to BST but supports a larger range of queries such as sum, minimum, maximum, and others, all in O(log n) time.

### K-D Tree

### Union-find / Disjoint Set

Data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.

A union-find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure:

Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.

Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.
